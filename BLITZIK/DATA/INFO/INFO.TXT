  We proudly present BlitZwav musik disk 
      for Atari STe 1mb - 1 floppy
                                          

BlitZwav features a list of great tunes by
    Dok who have kindly accepted to
  compose for BlitSnd routine and tools

BlitZwav features this new sound technique
using blitter to mix 4 PCM voices and also
     provides 3 traditional YM voices

  This routine fits the upper border :)

            Interactive mode

           
  BlitZwav provides scripted FX sequences
 for each tune but also has an interactive
  mode to experience FX manually through
                 keyboard

    - use F1->F7 to select FX
    - other keys to trig FX options
  
    Look at README file for detailled
     keys mapping or just try ... :)



         Playing from menus mode


  If your STe is sensible to audio clicks
   (depending on the hardware activity
        blitter in particular...) 
you can use this mode to minimize glitches



              Autorun mode


     Run all tunes with corresponding
      FX sequences successively as a
             continuous demo
