## Rebirth - Cybernetics - 2015

Atari STe 8mhz

* 1+ mb & 2 floppy drives

or

* 2+ mb & 1 floppy drive

Releases

* RC7 - released at Sommarhack convention 4th July 2015
* RC8 - released 20th July 2015

Add data precache feature: if you have at least 2mb of RAM but only 1 floppy drive you can now run Rebirth	
maybe it can also solve problems for people having floppy timing problems

* in this case just keep your second floppy drive switched off
* if you run Rebirth with the 2 floppy drives switched on, it will load as before (without precache)
